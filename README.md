# MLB-streak-calculator
Python program that creates a CSV containing MLB players' hit-streak or strikeout-streak data. A player is considered to have a hit-streak/strikeout-streak if they played consecutive games in which they had a hit/strikeout (or conversely, a no-hit-streak/no-strikeout-streak if they played consecutive games in which they had no hits/strikeouts).
